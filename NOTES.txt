Will the dump interface be able to choose between ihex and srec?
    - perhaps make this a compile time option.

goals:
 - minimal data segment, ideally none
 - build-time configurable RAM or ROM linking via selectable ldscript
   - retargetable addresses at build time (for tacking on to an existing binary)
 - fully port-overridable functions (to allow for hand-assembler optimizaiton)
